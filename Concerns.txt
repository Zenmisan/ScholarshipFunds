This is the audit for your smart contract

1. High Severity: Denial of Service (DoS) Risk in removeStudentThe removeStudent function iterates through the studentList array to find the address to remove.The Problem: This operation has a time complexity of $O(N)$. As the list grows (e.g., 500+ students), the gas cost to loop through the array will increase. If the list becomes too large, the gas cost will exceed the block gas limit, and the transaction will always revert. You will effectively be unable to remove students.The Fix: You need to track the index of each student in the array within the Student struct. This makes removal $O(1)$ (constant time).Recommended Code Change:Soliditystruct Student {
    // ... other fields
    uint256 listIndex; // Add this to track position in array
}

function addStudent(...) public onlyOwner {
    // ... checks
    studentList.push(_studentAddress);
    students[_studentAddress] = Student({
        // ... other fields
        listIndex: studentList.length - 1 // Store the index
    });
}

function removeStudent(address _studentAddress) external onlyOwner {
    // ... checks
    uint256 indexToDelete = students[_studentAddress].listIndex;
    address lastStudentAddr = studentList[studentList.length - 1];

    // Move the last student to the slot of the student being deleted
    studentList[indexToDelete] = lastStudentAddr;
    students[lastStudentAddr].listIndex = indexToDelete; // Update the moved student's index

    studentList.pop();
    delete students[_studentAddress];
    // emit event...
}
2. Medium Severity: getAllStudents Unbounded ViewThe function getAllStudents returns the entire array of structs.The Problem: If the array is large, this view function may fail on the front end or RPC provider because the data payload is too heavy, or it runs out of gas (even view functions have gas limits when called on-chain by other contracts).The Fix: Implement pagination (e.g., getStudents(uint256 offset, uint256 limit)).3. Gas Optimization: Expensive String StorageYou are storing string name in the Student struct.The Problem: Storing strings in contract state is very expensive (SSTORE). The contract logic never uses the name (it only uses the address and amount).The Fix: Remove name from the struct. Store the name in the StudentAdded event only. Events are much cheaper than state storage. You can index the events off-chain (using The Graph or a simple backend) to display names on your UI.4. Logic Inconsistency: depositFunds vs receiveObservation:depositFunds is restricted to onlyOwner.receive() is external payable (open to everyone).The Issue: This is inconsistent. If the intention is to allow anyone to donate to the scholarship, depositFunds shouldn't be onlyOwner. If the intention is to restricting funding to the admin only, receive() should also be onlyOwner (or removed).Recommendation: Remove onlyOwner from depositFunds to allow public donations, or rely solely on receive.5. EVM Version Warning (Pragma 0.8.20)Observation: You are using ^0.8.20.The Issue: Solidity 0.8.20 introduced the PUSH0 opcode. While supported on Ethereum Mainnet, some L2s (like older versions of Arbitrum, Optimism, or sidechains) might not fully support it yet, causing deployment to fail or behave unexpectedly.Recommendation: If deploying to a specific L2, check their PUSH0 support. If unsure, pin the version to 0.8.19 or add the configuration evmVersion: "paris" in your Hardhat/Foundry config.Summary of VulnerabilitiesSeverityIssueDescription🔴 High$O(N)$ LoopremoveStudent will fail if the list is long (Block Gas Limit).🟡 MediumUnbounded ViewgetAllStudents will fail to return data for large lists.🔵 LowExpensive StorageStoring string name wastes gas.🔵 LowInconsistencydepositFunds is restricted, but receive is open.Optimized Code Snippet (Gas & Logic)Here is the optimized Student struct and addStudent function to solve the critical looping issue and save gas:Soliditystruct Student {
    // string name;  <-- REMOVED (Save gas, read from Events instead)
    uint256 amount;
    uint256 listIndex; // Added for O(1) removal
    bool hasClaimed;
    bool isRegistered;
}

// In addStudent:
emit StudentAdded(_studentAddress, _name, _amount); // Pass name here for off-chain indexing
